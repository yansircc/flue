/**
 * Complete error framework for Flue.
 *
 * This file contains both the error vocabulary (concrete error classes) and
 * the framework utilities (renderers, type guards, request parsing helpers).
 *
 * ──── Why this file exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Concentrating every error in one file is deliberate. When all errors are
 * visible together, it's easy to:
 *
 *   - Keep message tone and detail level consistent across the codebase.
 *   - Notice duplicates ("oh, we already have an error for this case").
 *   - Establish norms by example — when adding a new error, look at the
 *     neighbors above and copy the pattern.
 *
 * Application code throughout the codebase should reach for one of these
 * classes rather than constructing a `FlueError` ad hoc. If no existing class
 * fits, add one here. That's the entire convention.
 *
 * ──── Two audiences: caller vs. developer ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The reader of an error message is one of two distinct audiences:
 *
 *   - The *caller*: an HTTP client. Possibly third-party, possibly hostile,
 *     possibly an end user who shouldn't even know we're built on Flue.
 *     Sees `message` and `details` always.
 *
 *   - The *developer*: the human running the service (`flue dev`, `flue run`,
 *     local debugging). Sees `dev` in addition, but only when the generated
 *     runtime is configured for local development.
 *
 * Every error class must classify its prose by audience. The required-but-
 * possibly-empty shape of both `details` and `dev` is the discipline:
 * forgetting either field is a TypeScript error, and writing `''` is a
 * deliberate "I have nothing for that audience" decision.
 *
 * Concretely:
 *
 *   - `message`     One sentence. Caller-safe. Always rendered.
 *   - `details`     Longer caller-safe prose. About the request itself, the
 *                   contract, what the caller can do to fix it. Always
 *                   rendered. NEVER includes:
 *                     - sibling/neighbor enumeration (leaks namespace)
 *                     - filesystem paths or "agents/" / "skills/" / etc.
 *                       (leaks framework internals)
 *                     - source-code-level fix instructions ("add ... to your
 *                       agent definition") (caller can't act on these)
 *                     - build-time or runtime mechanics
 *   - `dev`         Longer dev-audience prose. Available alternatives,
 *                   filesystem layout, framework guidance, source-code-level
 *                   fix instructions. Rendered ONLY in local development.
 *
 * When in doubt, put information in `dev`. The default is conservative.
 *
 * ──── Conventions for new error classes ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   - Class name: PascalCase, suffixed with `Error`. E.g. `AgentNotFoundError`.
 *   - The class owns its `type` constant (snake_case). Set once in the
 *     subclass constructor, never passed by callers. Renaming the wire type
 *     is then a one-line change.
 *   - Constructor takes ONLY structured input data (the values used to build
 *     the message). The constructor assembles `message`, `details`, and
 *     `dev` from that data, so call sites never reinvent phrasing.
 *   - `details` and `dev` are both required strings. Pass `''` only when
 *     there's genuinely nothing more to say for that audience.
 *   - For HTTP errors, the class sets its own `status` (and `headers` where
 *     relevant). Callers do not pick HTTP status codes ad-hoc.
 *
 * Worked example (matches `SkillNotRegisteredError` below):
 *
 *     new SkillNotRegisteredError({ skill, available, skillsDir });
 *     // builds:
 *     //   message: `Skill "foo" is not registered.`
 *     //   details: `Verify the skill name is correct.`
 *     //   dev:     `Available skills: "echo", "greeter". Skills are
 *     //            discovered at init() time from skills/<name>/SKILL.md
 *     //            inside the session's sandbox. ...`
 *
 * The wire response in production omits `dev`; in `flue dev` / `flue run`
 * it includes `dev`. That separation is what lets the dev field be richly
 * helpful without leaking namespace state to public callers.
 *
 * Counter-example to avoid:
 *
 *     class AgentNotFoundError extends FlueHttpError {
 *       constructor(message: string) {                       // ✗ free-form
 *         super({                                            // ✗ wrong type
 *           type: 'agent_error',
 *           message,
 *           details: 'Available: "x", "y", "z"',             // ✗ leaks names
 *           dev: '',                                         // ✗ wasted field
 *           status: 500,                                     // ✗ wrong status
 *         });
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * The structured-constructor pattern below is what prevents that drift.
