	//   can interleave writes with the terminal records; first-terminal-wins
	//   and the idempotent terminal path bound the damage to stray timeline
	//   entries.
	// - Narrow even if raced: racing reconcilers derive the reason from the
	//   same durable row facts, so their advisories are byte-identical and
	//   the terminal path's idempotency check absorbs the race; content can
	//   only diverge on an exact timeout-boundary clock race. A second

	// - Bounded damage: worst case is one advisory signal whose reason
	//   disagrees with the settle record. The settle record is the outcome
	//   authority; nothing downstream misclassifies, and (post settle
