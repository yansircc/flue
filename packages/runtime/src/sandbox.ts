/**
 * Interface that remote sandbox providers must implement.
 *
 * `exec()` cancellation is expressed two ways. Sandbox adapters should honor at
 * least one — preferably `timeoutMs`, since most provider SDKs expose a
 * native timeout option but few support mid-flight cancellation:
 *
 *   - `timeoutMs?: number` (milliseconds): the **primary** cancellation
 *     contract. Forward to the provider's native timeout option (E2B
 *     `timeoutMs`, Daytona `timeout`, Modal `timeout`, etc.). Providers
 *     with coarser granularity may round the value up, never down.
 *     Required for parity with the LLM bash tool, which always passes a
 *     deadline hint when the model requests one.
 *   - `signal?: AbortSignal` (optional): for sandbox adapters whose SDK supports
 *     mid-flight cancellation (Mirage's executor, in-process bash). Lets
 *     Programmatic callers do ad-hoc `abort()`. Sandbox adapters that can't honor it
 *     should ignore it; the deadline is still enforced via `timeoutMs`, and
 *     the {@link sandboxFromDriver} wrapper owns caller-facing abort:
 *     on abort it rejects promptly and treats the still-running command as an
 *     orphan ({@link OrphanedExecSettlement}). Adapters must not implement
 *     their own abort race — a second one is redundant and splits the orphan
 *     bookkeeping.
 *
 * Sandbox adapters that support both should observe whichever fires first.
 *
 * Liveness: an adapter should ensure in-flight operations settle when the
 * sandbox dies, by whatever mechanism its provider SDK supports — native
 * rejection of in-flight calls, or polling a cheap control-plane status read
 * while a call is pending (the first-party Cloudflare adapter does the latter
 * internally). An adapter with no such mechanism carries an accepted
 * limitation: when the provider transport never settles a call after the
 * sandbox dies, that call may hang until the surrounding operation is
 * aborted. There is deliberately no per-command deadline in this contract —
 * agent commands are legitimately unbounded, and `timeoutMs` is the command's
 * own deadline, not an infrastructure liveness bound. An adapter that detects
 * sandbox death should reject with `SandboxDiedError` (exported from
 * `@flue/runtime`), so shell classification reports an infrastructure failure
 * rather than caller cancellation.
