 * that teaches the model who it is and how to work. Return nothing for a
 * tools-only body. The author owns the formatting (headings included).
 *
 * An agent is an agent function that declares its model with `useModel()`,
 * and a delegate is an agent function on the `task` catalog —
 * `useSubagent({ name, description, agent: Delegate })`. Shared behavior is
 * composed with custom hooks: plain functions that call `useTool()`,
 * `useInstruction()`, and the other hooks, and may return values to the
 * agent body.

 * ```ts
 * function useRetention(active: () => boolean) {

 *     ...offerCredit,
 *     run: (ctx) => (active() ? offerCredit.run(ctx) : 'Refused: no churn risk on record.'),
 *   });
 *   useInstruction(
 *     'Only while the customer is weighing cancellation: you may offer retention incentives.',
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Nearly everything may be declared conditionally: tools, skills, and
 * subagents (the runtime narrates set changes to the model), persisted state
 * (keyed by name in the durable record log regardless of which renders
 * declared it), event hooks (each seam runs whatever the current render
 * declares, at-least-once per delivery), and the sandbox (a presence flip
 * swaps the environment at the next turn boundary). The one invariant:
 * message data (`useDataWriter`) names must be declared identically on every
 * render. Guards like the one above scope when an always-present tool may
 * act. Agent functions must return synchronously — async work lives in tools
 * and resource factories.
